# Contributing to Design System

JDRF's Design System is a method of enabling every vendor of [JDRF](https://www.jdrf.org) to apply the same level of branding to their sites. We're still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we're not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

## Our Development Process

All of the team will be working directly on GitHub.

### Test Suite

Use `npm run test` to run the full test suite with PhantomCSS and eventually PhantomJS.

Just make sure to run the whole test suite before submitting a pull request! Any PR without tests will be rejected.

### Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests.

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm run test`).
4. You have not committed compiled files (anything from the dist folder)

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. jsFiddle, jsBin, and other sites provide a way to give live examples. All issues should be reported through [Github](https://github.com/JDRF/design-system/issues).

## JS Style Guide

If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction.

## License

By contributing to JDRF Design System, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.
